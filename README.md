### Introduction

I recently came across an open-source Python DevOps framework [Kedro](https://kedro.org/) and thought, ‚ÄúWhy not  have [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) teach me how to use it to build some ML/DevOps automation?‚Äù The idea was to:
1. Ask ChatGPT some basic questions about Kedro.
2. Ask it to use more advanced features in the Kedro framework.
3. Write my questions with hints and phrases that encouraged explanations of advanced Kedro features (to evolve incrementally as if I were taught by a teacher).

Kedro has some pipeline visualization capabilities, so I wondered:
- Could ChatGPT show me how to display pipeline graphs in Streamlit?
- Could ChatGPT build me an example ML model and explicitly refer to it in the Kedro pipeline?
- What does it take to scale the pipeline, and perform pipeline logging, monitoring, and error handling?
- Could I connect Kedro logs to a cloud-based logging service?
- Could ChatGPT contrast Kedro with similar (competing) products and services and show me how the pipeline it developed earlier could be implemented in one of them?

I wrote a blog post with annotated responses to the answers I got to my questions. I was super impressed and decided to implement the Kedro pipeline and Streamlit application as planned from what I learned. This repository contains all the code for the application. 

### Try the Streamlit app yourself

The application can be seen running in the Streamlit Cloud at the link below:

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://asehmi-using-chatgpt-kedro-streamlit-ap-srcstreamlit-app-14bz3i.streamlit.app/)

- The source OCLH crypto currency data is supplied in a single CSV file, and was previously downloaded from the Bitfinex exchange
- OCLH data is for 4 coins spanning the period June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022
- OCLH data is in 15min frequency
- A Kedro data catalog of source and feature datasets is built for each coin and subsequently used in the Kedro ML pipeline
- You can run the Kedro ML pipeline to train, test and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict next period (t+1) close prices from several feature techical indicators derived from the close price and volume 
- You can visualize candlestick and line charts for the source and feature datasets, by coin
- Run locally, you can visualize an interactive graph representation of the Kedro pipeline in the Streamlit application
- You can run the pipeline nodes and the pipeline visualization from the command line too, using Kedro's CLI tools

For Streamlit beginners, this aplication can be useful to learn how to:
- Structure a multipage application
- Use session state
- Use widget callbacks
- Use many different widgets
- Launch sub-processes
- Embed external GUIs
- Cache data and clear caches
- Plotly charting
- (Check out my [gists](https://gist.github.com/asehmi) for more Streamlit goodies)

## Installation

(_On Windows replace forward slashes with back slashes._)

Clone this repository, then install package requirements:

```bash
$ cd using_chatgpt_kedro_streamlit_app
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

**Run the Streamlit app**:

```bash
$ cd using_chatgpt_kedro_streamlit_app
$ streamlit run --server.port=2023 src/streamlit_app.py
```

**Run the Kedo pipeline from the command line**:

```bash
$ cd using_chatgpt_kedro_streamlit_app
$ kedro run
```

You should see a trace similar to this:
